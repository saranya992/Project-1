# Project


To complete the Redbus Data Scraping project, we need to install and set up a few tools and libraries on your computer. Here's a simplified breakdown:
1. Tools and Software to Install
•	Python
•	Jupyter Notebook or IDE
•	MySQL Server
• VS code

2. Python Libraries to Install
•	Selenium: Used for web scraping. It automates browsers to collect data from websites like Redbus.
•	MySQL Connector: Allows Python to interact with MySQL databases.
•	Pandas: A library for handling and analyzing data in Python.
•	Streamlit: Used to create web applications easily with Python, like the one you’ll use to display and filter the scraped data.

3. Database Setup
•	Create a Database: Once MySQL is installed, create a database where you’ll store all the bus data.
•	Create Tables: Inside the database, create tables to store the information like bus routes, prices, etc.

4. Running Your Project
•	Web Scraping with Selenium: Write Python scripts to automate the data collection from Redbus using Selenium.
•	Store Data in MySQL: After scraping the data, store it in the MySQL database using Python’s MySQL connector.
•	Create a Streamlit App: Build an interactive web application using Streamlit to display and filter the data you’ve collected.
